# Advance DDOS

I have been asked to give a talk on distributed denial of service attack. This folder contains the latex files for the presentation and the system I developed for the talk.

The system is a bit more sophisticated than that which is presented in the parent folder.

This software is only developed for educational purpose and without the intend to cause harm please respect that.

__NOTE__ It is not legal to perform a dDOS attack unless your a testing a system you own or haven been asked to test.
